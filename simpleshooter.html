        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
          This SimpleShooter game is a fairly basic and straight forward 3rd
          person shooter, again done in Unreal Engine. The Map itself was
          pre-made and the Player/NPC assets themselves come from the
          Paragon:Wraith pack on the Unreal Store. The game has you the player
          move through a command center and eliminate hostiles, the AI has some
          basic features in that if you are spotted they will chase and fire
          when within range. The win condition is simple, destroy all enemy
          targets before you find yourself at 0 hit points.

        <h2>Why I Did This Project</h2>
        <p>
          This project was the final one in the
          <a
            href="https://www.udemy.com/course/unrealcourse/?couponCode=ACCAGE0923"
            target="_blank"

          >
          course, and to be fair probably my favorite project. It took the
          fundamentals that were laid out in ToonTanks and really expanded on
          them. It was the first time implementing true animations in Unreal,
          and introduced everything from Blend Spaces to Animation Blue Prints.
          This course expanded upon the use of widgets allowing for, albeit
          basic, a actual HUD that was similar enough to so many games I had
          enjoyed before.
        </p>
        <p>
          One of the most exciting aspects of this project was creating a more
          engaging AI enemy character, moving beyond the static Towers in
          ToonTanks that merely aimed and fired at the player. I explored
          Behavior Trees and Blackboards, which enabled me to design enemies
          capable of perceiving and reacting to the player. In this aspect I
          felt like I was understanding finally how the world itself could
          perceive and interact with the Player in order to create a more
          interesting game play loop.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project took the concepts and fundamentals that had been laid out
          in earlier courses and allowed me to create a game close to something
          I could play.
