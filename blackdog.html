        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>
          BlackDog is a third-person action RPG where players fight to survive
          for as long as they can. The game mode is a basic Wave Mode, where
          when all enemies are destroyed more enemies spawn than before. The
          player fights to see how long they can last while utilizing the shop
          to purchase things such as new weapons and health potions.

          <h2>Inventory</h2>
          <img src="images/inventory.png" alt="Inventory Screenshot" />
          <p>
            <strong>Core System:</strong> The player's inventory is
            fundamentally an array of items. Each item belongs to a specific
            type, determined by an enum, such as Weapons, Consumables, and other
            categories. Each item type handles its unique functionality while
            sharing a consistent display format.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Display and User Interface:</strong> The inventory is
            visualized through an <em>Inventory Widget</em>, which is populated
            with <em>InventorySlotWidgets</em>. These slots display the item's
            image, name, value, and additional relevant details like damage for
            weapons.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Player Interaction:</strong> Players can interact with items
            in the inventory using custom functions for actions such as selling
            (when at a shop), using, or acquiring new items. The inventory
            updates dynamically whenever changes occur, triggered by a function
            in the player's custom controller class.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Weapon Swapping:</strong> Right-clicking on a weapon allows
            the player to swap their equipped weapon. The currently equipped
            weapon is displayed via in the <em>Primary Weapon Slot</em>, visible
            whenever the inventory is opened.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Opening the Inventory:</strong> The player's inventory can
            be accessed at any time by pressing the "I" key, allowing seamless
            management of their items during gameplay.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div id="modal-shop" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
          <span class="close" onclick="closeModal('shop')">&times;</span>
          <h2>Shop</h2>
          <img src="images/shop.png" alt="Shop Screenshot" />
          <p>
            <strong>Item Management:</strong> The shop maintains a predetermined
            set of items, organized similarly to the player's inventory. An
            array of items is used to generate and populate a custom widget
            blueprint made up of individual inventory slot widgets.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Buying Items:</strong> Items in the shop are tagged with a
            <em>Shop</em>
            enum value. Right-clicking on an item deducts its value from the
            player's currency and adds the item to the player's inventory,
            followed by an inventory update.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Selling Items:</strong> When an item is sold, it is
            discarded from the player's inventory, and its value is added to the
            player's currency via the <code>gainCurrency</code> function.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Shop Interaction Radius:</strong> The shop operates within a
            set radius. The player tracks if they are in range of a shop and
            updates a Variable with said shop, this could allow the creation of
            multiple shops at a later time and allow differentiating between
            them.

      <div id="modal-combat" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-content">
          <span class="close" onclick="closeModal('combat')">&times;</span>
          <h2>Combat</h2>
          <img src="images/combat.gif" alt="Combat Screenshot" />
          <p>
            <strong>Attack System:</strong> When the attack button is pressed,
            an attack animation is played. During the animation, an
            <em>Anim Notify State</em> determines when the weapon is actively
            dealing damage. A single line trace runs every tick during the
            swing, and on a successful hit, the target's
            <code>TakeDamage</code> function is called, applying the weapon's
            damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Dynamic Attack Speed:</strong> Each weapon and actor's
            attack speed varies, which adjusts the animation speed dynamically.
            Swapping weapons updates the attack speed and animation in the
            <em>Animation Blueprint</em>. Flags differentiate between one-handed
            and two-handed weapons for handling different attack animations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Damage Numbers:</strong> A small widget displaying the
            damage dealt is attached to the target and always faces the player's
            camera. This creates a dynamic damage feedback system similar to
            games like <em>Diablo</em>, enhancing immersion.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Sound Effects:</strong> Swing and hit sound effects are
            assigned to weapon blueprints for a customizable experience. Swing
            sounds are triggered via an <em>Anim Notify</em> at the start of the
            animation for proper synchronization. Hit sounds, along with
            particle effects, are triggered in the hit detection function and
            play at the hit location for added impact.

          <img src="images/ai.png" alt="AI Behavior Screenshot" />
          <p>
            <strong>Behavior Trees:</strong> A custom behavior tree was used to control the AI's decision-making process. This tree manages key actions such as patrolling, chasing the player, and attacking.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Blackboard Integration:</strong> The blackboard serves as a shared data structure for the behavior tree, storing dynamic AI data such as the player's position, whether the player is detected, and patrol locations.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Custom BTService Classes:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>PlayerLocation:</strong> Updates the blackboard with the player's current location, ensuring the AI has up-to-date information for decision-making.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>PlayerLocationIfSeen:</strong> A more specific service that updates the blackboard only if the player is within the AI's line of sight.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Custom BTTask Classes:</strong> 
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Attack:</strong> Handles the execution of the attack logic, including playing attack animations and dealing damage to the player.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>SetRandomPatrolLocation:</strong> Randomly selects patrol points within a designated area, keeping the AI dynamic and unpredictable during idle states.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Custom AI Controller:</strong> A custom C++ AI Controller was developed to manage AI perception and behavior tree execution. Key features include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Perception System:</strong> Uses the <em>UAIPerceptionComponent</em> and <em>UAISenseConfig_Sight</em> to detect the player within a defined sight radius and angle. This system dynamically updates the blackboard when the player is detected or lost.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Player Detection:</strong> Updates blackboard values such as <code>Player</code>, <code>PlayerLocation</code>, and <code>PlayerDetected</code> based on perception stimuli.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Spawn Location:</strong> Stores and manages the AI's initial spawn location, allowing for dynamic patrol routes and reset behavior.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>AI Behavior Tree Breakdown:</strong> The behavior tree includes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Selector Nodes:</strong> Evaluate different branches, such as chasing the player or patrolling, based on blackboard conditions.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sequence Nodes:</strong> Handle sequential actions like rotating to face the player, attacking, and waiting before executing the next action.
              </li>
            </ul>
