        <h2>About ToonTanks</h2>
        <p>
          ToonTanks is an straightforward single-player game where the player
          controls a tank and battles enemy towers in a stylized battlefield.
          Players must strategically navigate the terrain, avoid enemy fire, and
          destroy all towers to emerge victorious!

        <h2>Why I Did This Project</h2>
        <p>
          ToonTanks was one of the more complete projects in the

          course. It marked a pivotal moment for me, where the connection
          between C++ and Unreal Engine's Blueprint system became clear. This
          project introduced me to the fundamentals of game development, such as
          spawning objects like projectiles at runtime rather than only
          assigning them during compile time. I particularly enjoyed seeing how
          inheritance, a core programming concept, could be applied to reuse
          functions for handling damage and spawning projectiles. It was also my
          first experience manipulating meshes, like adjusting the tank's turret
          for aiming, and experimenting with sound effects to bring the game to
          life. These small but essential lessons gave me the confidence to
          dream bigger. For the first time, I began to think, "How would I
          implement this?" whenever a small feature in a game stood out to me.
          This project was a significant step toward making my dream of game
          development feel achievable.
