            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Killian Hasson, I am a United States Marine Corps
              veteran and recent graduate from Portland State University with a
              Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. I have been
              playing video games for as long as I can remember, quite literally
              one of my first memories was playing Super Mario Bros on the NES
              in 1999 and I haven't stopped since. At some point early in my
              life it became a dream to become a Marine like my father and so
              many others in my family; it felt like the natural course of
              action.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2013, the day after graduating High School I shipped off to
              MCRD San Diego, where I officially earned the title of United
              States Marine. After Basic Training I would attend School of
              Infantry aboard Camp Pendleton and eventually jump between a few
              different duty stations those being MCAS Miramar, Camp Lejeune and
              eventually finding myself back aboard Camp Pendleton. After a few
              years the opportunity to deploy with Special Purpose Marine Air
              Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF) 16 for Operation Inherent Resolve
              would appear and I would gratefully take it. While deployed I
              would earn my first Navy Achievement Medal and be faced with my
              biggest decision yet, staying in the Marine Corps or pursuing a
              new adventure.
            </p>
            <p>
              In 2017, I separated from the Marine Corps and was unsure of the
              future, while reflecting on my past and what I wanted to do
              something occurred to me. I had never once stopped playing video
              games, even while deployed I spent 3 days on slow internet in the
              Morale, Welfare, and Recreation (MWR) tent downloading the latest
              World of Warcraft expansion. My first purchase with my first check
              in the Marines was for a Alienware 17, just so I could play Diablo
              3 and everything else I happened upon. That's when I realized,
              Video Games were my passion, they always had been but school felt
              like a task I couldn't complete, but I had to try.
            </p>
            <p>
              After years of school, countless failures, and twice as many
              accomplishments, I managed to acquire my degree. Here I am now,
              finally putting forth the things I have learned in college toward
              my true dream of breaking into the world of Game Development. A
              dream to shape and influence something that has been such a
              foundational part of my life, helping me to overcome everything
              from PTSD to depression and anxiety. As I move forward, I remind
              myself of a truth I’ve come to believe:
              <em>Success isn’t measured in miles, but in inches</em>. Every
              small step I take brings me closer to building a career and a life
              I can be proud of.
